# Transmute

A Blockchain framework for Identity and Compliance.

ðŸš§ Pardon our mess as we upgrade to support kubernetes. ðŸš§

ðŸ”¥ DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION ðŸ”¥

### The transmute framework is a library for connecting off-chain data with on-chain smart contracts.

This implementation is not optimized for cost, but for rapid prototyping. The framework is meant for developing proof of concepts quickly, and not currently ready for production use.

With the framework come tutorials for managing ethereum depenencies with kubernetes locally or with cloud providers.

### Recommended Setup

#### Note: Use npm with this project, yarn does not play nicely with lerna setup.

We provide test infrastructure to run the project, without the need to run a local testnet or ipfs and deploy contracts:

```
npm install -g lerna
git clone https://github.com/transmute-industries/transmute.git
lerna bootstrap
lerna run build --ignore transmute-contracts --ignore transmute-framework --ignore transmute-alpha
lerna run build --scope transmute-framework
```

#### Advanced Setup

If you wish to run everything locally, you can use this minikube setup:

* [Setup Minikube](https://github.com/transmute-industries/transmute/tree/master/tutorials/minikube)
* [Setup IPFS](https://github.com/transmute-industries/transmute/tree/master/tutorials/minikube/ipfs)
* [Setup Ganache-CLI](https://github.com/transmute-industries/transmute/tree/master/tutorials/minikube/ganache-cli)

When using minikube, before running scripts, you will want to export these env vars:

```
export GANACHE_CLI=$(minikube --namespace transmute-testrpc  service transmute-testrpc-ganache-cli --url )
export IPFS_GATEWAY=$(minikube service --url ipfs-gateway --namespace transmute-ipfs)
export IPFS_API=$(minikube service --url ipfs-api --namespace transmute-ipfs)
```

### Compliance Demo

Many compliance use cases involve linking off-chain data to on-chain smart contracts, which can provide an immutable audit log. Such transactions are expensive, but with the transmute framework some cost can be saved through off chain storage, via a hopefully familar redux interface.

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to write events to ethereum smart contracts, and how ReadModels represent the state of a smart contract as it processes each event. ReadModels can be saved to databases and queried over time, and are an interface for off chain services.

You'll learn:

* How to create an eventstore contract.
* How to save an event with an adapter.
* How to use a ReadModel to get a smart contracts state.

To get started, navigate to the `transmute-compliance-demo` directory.

```
cd packages/transmute-compliance-demo
```

Follow the instructions in the [Compliance Demo Read Me](./packages/transmute-compliance-demo)
